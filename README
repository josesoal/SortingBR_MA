Introduction
============

This directory contains the source code of the implementation of the following
algorithm:
- Memetic Algorithm for the SUPBR problem (MA).

The authors of the implementations are:
	Jose Luis Soncco-Alvarez (jose.soncco.alvarez@gmail.com)
	and
	Mauricio Ayala-Rincon (ayala@unb.br)

Both authors from the Group of Theory of Computation at the University of
Brasilia.

(SUPBR - "Sorting Unsigned Permutations by Reversals")

Setup
=====

The source code was tested under MAC OSX and UBUNTU LINUX platforms. As first
step we need to execute the makefile:
$ make clean all -f makefile.ma

The previous command will generate the executable "ma". 

Input Data
==========

Initially, the input data was intended to be two permutations that correspond
to the gene order of two organisms with the same gene set. We assume that the
genes of the second organism are represented as increasing naturals, leading
to a identity permutation. Then, we JUST NEED as input the first permutation,
which maintains the same natural number representation for each gene but in
the order of the first organism. 

For instance, if the input data is the permutation {2,4,3,1}, it will have the 
following format:
4
2
4
3
1

The first line is the length of the permutation, that is, the number of genes
of an organism. The remaining lines are the gene order of an organism.

The SUPBR problem consists in finding the minimum number of reversals for
transforming an unsigned permutation into the identity permutation.

Usage
=====

The program "ma" has the following parameter options:

-s : seed for srand() [default: time(NULL)]
-g : number of generations to stop program 
     [default: -1 = number of generations is the input length ]
-e : number of evaluations to stop program 
     [default: -1 = this feature is not used]
-r : number of reversals to stop program 
     [default: -1 = this feature is not used]
-m : print mode [default: final_result]
        options:
        -m final_result : print number of reversals, number of evaluations of
                          fitness function, and number of used generations
        -m best_by_gen  : print the best solution by generation
        -m eval_by_gen  : print the number of evaluations of fitness function
                          by generation

Note: The input permutation must be in a file labeled as "i", in this 
directory is included the file "i" with a permutation of length 50. 	

Examples of use of "ma":

(1) For printing the number of reversals (1st line of output), and using as
    stop condition a number of generations equal to the input length (number 
    of genes):
    $  ./ma -m final_result
    or just
    $ ./ma
    The output of the previous command will also print the number of
    evaluations of the fitness function and the number of used generations 
    at the 2nd and 3rd line of the output.
(2) The same as (1), and fixing the seed (say 77) for the rand() function.
    $ ./ma -s 77 -m final_result
    The output of the previous command will print always the same number of
    reversals, change the seed to see a different output.
(3) For printing the number of reversals, and using as stop condition a number
    of generations equal to some number (say 100):
    $ ./ma -g 100 -m final_result
(4) For printing the number of reversals, and using as stop condition a number
    of evaluations of the fitness function (say 1000):
    $ ./ma -e 1000 -m final_result
    Note that in case the program does not reach the number of specified
    evaluations, the program will use as stop condition the number of
    generations.
(5) For printing the number of reversals, and using as stop condition a number
    of generations (say 100), or a number of evaluations (say 1500), or a
    number of reversals (say 40):
    $ ./ma -g 100 -e 1500 -r 40 -m final_result
    Note that the program will stop if one of the stop conditions is met.
(6) For printing the best solution by generation:
    $ ./ma -best_by_gen
    Note that the stop condition is a number of generations equal to the
    input length.
(7) For printing the number of evaluations of the fitness function by
    generation:
    $ ./ma -eval_by_gen
    Note that the stop condition is a number of generations equal to the
    input length.
